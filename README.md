# About This Project/Me

This app allows users to create their desired musical setting by
mixing the volumes of their chosen soundtracks. This project was a
familiarization vehicle for me to learn and practice React in my
chase to launch a career in web development. This was also my
first sizeable coding project that required time and dedication,
of which I had the thrill of experimenting with audio, animations
and general React functionalities. To see my other projects or for

# Functionalities

  Click on one of the white squares to play its corresponding
  soundtrack and adjust its volume with the slider below the square.
  To stop the soundtrack, click on the square again. From left to
  right, the functionalities on the bottom are as follows:
  <ul className="functionalities-list">
    <li>
     Power Switch: Pauses all active soundtracks and if active, the
     timer. Retains the memory of active soundtracks and will resume
     when the power switch is turned back on (as will the timer if it
     was active).
    </li>
    <li>
     Fireflies â€“ Input: Controls the amount of fireflies on the
     screen (0 - 100), can be directly changed by typing a new number
     in or by using the plus/minus counter buttons. The red cancel
     button will set the amount of fireflies to zero.
    </li>
    <li>
     Reset All: Resets all settings to the initial settings and turns
     all active soundtracks off.
    </li>
    <li>
     Timer: Follows a MM:SS format. Can be directly changed by typing
     the values in. Hit the play button to start the timer, and the
     same button to pause the timer. When the timer ends, all active
     soundtracks will be turned off.
    </li>
  </ul>
