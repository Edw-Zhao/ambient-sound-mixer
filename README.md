# About This Project/Me

This app allows users to create their desired musical setting by
mixing the volumes of their chosen soundtracks. This project was a
familiarization vehicle for me to learn and practice React in my
chase to launch a career in web development. This was also my
first sizeable coding project that required time and dedication,
of which I had the thrill of experimenting with audio, animations
and general React functionalities. To see my other projects or for
